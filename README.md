## 🔧 Installation  

MMRL and MMRL++ build upon [CoOp](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/CoOp) and [MaPLe](https://github.com/muzairkhattak/multimodal-prompt-learning). Please refer to the [CoOp](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/CoOp) repository for dataset setup instructions. We sincerely appreciate their contributions!

To set up the runtime environment, you can follow the guidelines provided in the [CoOp](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/CoOp) repository or use the step-by-step instructions below (recommended) to create and configure your environment.

* Setup conda environment (recommended).
```bash
# Create a conda environment
conda create -y -n mmrl python=3.10

# Activate the environment
conda activate mmrl

# Install torch (requires version >= 1.8.1) and torchvision
# Please refer to https://pytorch.org/ if you need a different cuda version
pip install torch==2.4.0 torchvision==0.19.0 torchaudio==2.4.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

* Install [Dassl](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/Dassl.pytorch) library.
```bash
# Instructions borrowed from https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/Dassl.pytorch#installation

# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/Dassl.pytorch.git
cd Dassl.pytorch/

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install this library (no need to re-build if the source code is modified)
python setup.py develop
cd ..
```

* Clone MMRL code repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yunncheng/MMRL.git
cd MMRL/
```



## 🚀 Running the Code  

We provide various scripts for different experimental settings. The main scripts are:

- `base_to_novel.sh` (Base-to-Novel Generalization)
- `cross_datasets.sh` (Cross-Dataset Evaluation and Domain Generalization)
- `few_shot.sh` (Few-Shot Learning)
- Detailed bash scripts in `scripts/mmrl` and `scripts/mmrlpp`

To run the experiments, navigate to the MMRL root directory and execute the corresponding script. Make sure to replace `DATA` with the path to your dataset in `scripts/mmrl` and `scripts/mmrlpp`.  
### **Base-to-Novel Generalization**  

Run the following command:  

```bash
bash base_to_novel.sh
```

You can modify configurations in:  
- `trainer/config.py`  
- `configs/trainers/MMRL/vit_b16.yaml`  
- `configs/trainers/MMRL/vit_b16_imagenet.yaml`  
- `configs/trainers/MMRLpp/vit_b16.yaml`  
- `configs/trainers/MMRLpp/vit_b16_imagenet.yaml`  

### **Cross-Dataset Evaluation and Domain Generalization**  

Run the following command:  

```bash
bash cross_datasets.sh
```

You can adjust configurations in:  
- `trainer/config.py`  
- `configs/trainers/MMRL/vit_b16_cross_datasets.yaml`  
- `configs/trainers/MMRLpp/vit_b16_cross_datasets.yaml`  
- `scripts/mmrl/cross_datasets_train.sh`  
- `scripts/mmrl/cross_datasets_test.sh`   

**Note:** Ensure that the `REP_DIM` value remains consistent between training on ImageNet and testing on other datasets when runing MMRL.  

### **Few-Shot Learning**  

Run the following command:  

```bash
bash few_shot.sh
```

Configurations can be adjusted in:  
- `trainer/config.py`
- `configs/trainers/MMRL/vit_b16_few_shot.yaml`
- `configs/trainers/MMRL/vit_b16_imagenet.yaml`
- `configs/trainers/MMRLpp/vit_b16_few_shot.yaml`
- `configs/trainers/MMRLpp/vit_b16_imagenet.yaml`



## ✨ MMRL++

MMRL++ is an extension of MMRL that introduces:
- **Shared-Residual Representation Aligner (SRRA):** A parameter-efficient design for gradient and information sharing.
- **Progressive Representation Composition (PRC):** Enhances intra-modal interaction via inter-layer instance-specific semantic flow.

It achieves stronger generalization with fewer trainable parameters while maintaining or improving performance across multiple benchmarks.
